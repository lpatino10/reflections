What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The directory you're in becomes a git repository. You need to do this
to get the .git metadata that allows you to exercise its version
control abilities.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the intermediate point. Ot has things from the working
directory that will be placed into the repository. I think it adds
flexibility, as the user can choose exactly what they want committed at 
one time. 


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

I can just add what is logical to bunch together, instead of having to 
commit and then go on with doing my work.
