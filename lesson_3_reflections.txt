When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

If you're sharing with others, it makes sense to have a remote repository 
to collaborate. That way, other people can easily access your files.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might be doing your own offshoot of a project, so Git automatically
writing over that would be pretty annoying.
