When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

If you're sharing with others, it makes sense to have a remote repository 
to collaborate. That way, other people can easily access your files.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might be doing your own offshoot of a project, so Git automatically
writing over that would be pretty annoying.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?

Branches are just used within one repository to keep track of different
changes being made (bug fixes, new features). Cloning and forking is 
similar, but cloning is done to pull a repository from GitHub to your
local repository, while forking is done to make changes to someone
else's public repo when you're not a collaborator. You can edit their
things without messing with their stuff but while still giving them
the credit for coming up with it. It's basically a fancy, collaborative
clone.
